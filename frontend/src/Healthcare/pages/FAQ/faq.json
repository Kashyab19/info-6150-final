        "question": "What do you mean by “comparable coverage”?",
        "answer": "If your current plan is an HMO, your coverage will likely be limited—or not available—outside of your HMO’s service area. As a result, it probably won’t be considered a “comparable” plan."

        "question": "What should I know before waiving coverage?",
        "answer": "Before waiving coverage, review your current policy and then consider these questions: • Does your plan comply with the ACA? (See the FAQ, “What do you mean by 'comparable coverage'?”)• Will your current plan cover medical care beyond emergency services (i.e. doctor's office visits, diagnostic testing, x-rays, prescription drugs, mental health, etc.) on- and off-campus?"
